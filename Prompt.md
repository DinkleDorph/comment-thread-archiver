I will send you a series of screenshots of a Reddit comment thread, one at a time. Each screenshot will be accompanied by context like “Image 1 of 8” or “Root comment.”

Your task is to:

1. **Extract all comment text**, including usernames and timestamps.
2. Detect and **merge any overlapping text** across screenshots.
3. Assume screenshots are in **correct top-to-bottom order**, from the root comment to the final replies.
4. Use **username, profile picture**, and **comment layout** to determine where each new comment starts.

Use indentation, user profile picture, and reply positioning to guess nesting.

After each image, respond with:

- `"OK – Continue."` if everything looks good, or
- `"ERROR – <message>"` if something went wrong or is unclear.

After the last image, please output:

- The full reconstructed thread, and
- If possible, structure it as **nested JSON** to reflect parent → child replies. If nesting is uncertain, provide a **flat structured JSON** of all comments.

The JSON structure should look like this for nested:
```
{
    "url": "[URL for the post]",
    "structure": "nested",
    "comments": [
        {
            "text": "This is a root comment!",
            "children": [
                {
                    "text": "This is a child comment.",
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The JSON structure should look like this for flat:
```
{
    "url": "[URL for the post]",
    "structure": "flat",
    "comments": [
        {
            "text": "This is a root comment!"
        },
        {
            "text": "This is a child comment.",
        }
    ]
}
```
